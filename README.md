Introduction to Docker reference code
=====================================

Links to all the source code and solutions I reference in my O'Reilly Introduction to Docker video tutorial.

Dockerfiles
-----------

In the Dockerfiles segment, we start by building a custom Dockerfile for a MongoDB server:

We also "Dockerize" a static webserver powered by Nginx. The starter code can be found here:

A complete workflow
-------------------

In this segment, we "Dockerize" a sample web application powered by Flask. The starter code can be found here:

https://github.com/atbaker/flask-example/

**Don't forget to destroy your DigitalOcean server at the end of this segment if you don't plan to keep using it!**

Using Fig
---------

In this segment, we use Fig to manage a sample Django web application along with a PostgreSQL database and a Memcached server. The starter code can be found here:
